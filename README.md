<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

### Installation

Custom Car Manager doesn't need installation as it is a standalone program.  
The one thing you do need to have installed is Java 17 or newer. You can install that [here](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.3.1_windows-x64_bin.exe).  

### Setup

1. 
    When you run CCM for the first time, you will get a warning telling you to set your Derail Valley installation directory.

    You can simply press Close.


2. 
    To set your Derail Valley installation directory, click the "Select Installation Directory" button.

    If you're unsure where Derail Valley is installed, you can find it in Steam.
      1. Right click on Derail Valley
      2. Click "Properties"
      3. Click "Local Files"
      4. Click "Browse"

      The directory that opens in File Explorer is your Derail Valley installation directory.  
      You can copy this directory to your clipboard by right-clicking the "Derail Valley" in the menu bar, and clicking "Copy address".

3. 
    Once your installation directory is set, you should see any cars you currently have installed in the "Installed Cars" section.

### Installing Cars

Installing cars can be done in one of two ways. They can be installed from a `.zip` file, or from a folder.  
Both methods support installing multiple cars at once.

To install cars from a folder, click the "Install Car(s) from Folder" button.

Now simply navigate to the folder where the car is located, and select it. CCM will now install the car.

Installing cars from `.zip` files is basically the same process, except you slect the `.zip` file instead of the folder.

### Uninstalling Cars

Uninstalling cars is as simple as pressing the `Delete` button next to the car you want to uninstall.
